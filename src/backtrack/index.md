# Backtrack? What?

In short: Spotistats for Spotify will soon be renamed to Backtrack for Spotify

## Why?

The name Spotistats is against Spotify's terms of service (a name may not start with "Spot"). Aside from that it's time to make a step into the direction of Apple Music and other streamingservices. The name Spotistats wouldn't fit that well ;)

## Why Backtrack?

Together with the awesome [Discord community](https://discord.gg/spotistats) we've been brainstorming about a new name for over half a year now. Over a thousand suggestions were made and I've posted polls about the top suggestions on Twitter, and after the final poll Backtrack has won the majority of the votes.

The "Back" stand for the past, since you're looking at stats of your past. And the "track" stands for tracking your streams, which are then used to taylor stats to you :)

## When?

Somewhere in November 2021. The name will gradually change and you'll first see a notice in the app which announces the new name. About a week after the notice the name in the Play and App Store will change together with the name of the app on your phone. For a few weeks the name in the Play and App Store will have "formerly Spotistats" in the name to avoid confusion :)

## What's gonna happen to spotistats.app?

The new domain name for Backtrack will be [https://getbacktrack.app](https://getbacktrack.app)
