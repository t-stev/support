Request your data from Spotify</h3><p>In order to request your <code>endsong.json</code> files you&#39;ll need to send Spotify a simple email. You can use this as a template:</p><blockquote><p>Hi, <br><br> I would like to receive a copy of my extended lifetime streaming history in technical endsong.json format. The data requested from the privacy tab on the spotify.com/account page only includes the data of last year, and I want my lifetime data (so the endsong.json files). A link to my Spotify profile is <code>link to your Spotify profile</code> and my username is <code>your username</code>. A song I&#39;ve recently added to my library is &quot;<code>name of a song youve recently added to your library</code>&quot; by <code>name of the artist</code>. And just to be sure: I don&#39;t want the data I can request myself with the button on my account page, I&#39;m looking for the &quot;endsong.json&quot; files. <br><br>Best regards, <br><code>your name</code></p></blockquote><p>You can send this email to <code>privacy@spotify.com</code>, and if you <strong>send this from the emailadress linked to your Spotify account</strong> that will make the process easier and a lot quicker. Otherwise they may ask for another way to verify your identification (naming a song you&#39;ve recently added to your library already does this, but they can still reject that).</p><h3 id="_2-confirm-your-request"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-confirm-your-request">#</a> 2. Confirm your request</h3><p>When your request is accepted by Spotify they&#39;ll email you a link to confirm the request. Click &quot;confirm&quot; and they&#39;ll start gathering your data. <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/830562126560231464/830562247663288411/step-2.png" alt="Step 2 image"></p><h3 id="_3-turn-on-the-streams-sync-to-prevent-a-gap-in-your-data"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-turn-on-the-streams-sync-to-prevent-a-gap-in-your-data">#</a> 3. Turn on the Streams Sync to prevent a gap in your data</h3><p>The files you receive from Spotify miss the last 2-5 days of data. For example: if you&#39;ve requested the data on June 1st and you&#39;ve received the data on June 14th, the data will include streams untill ~June 12th. Since you (of course) want accurate data you can turn on the Streams Sync after you&#39;ve requested your files (so at this step). You can do that in Settings &gt; Import management &gt; Sync streaminghistory. Make sure to set this to &quot;enabled&quot;. You can read more about the Stream Sync <a href="/streams/sync">here</a>)</p><p><img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/830562126560231464/870771640445829190/image0.png?width=211&amp;height=457" alt="Step 3 image"></p><h3 id="_4-wait-till-your-data-arrives-in-your-email"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-wait-till-your-data-arrives-in-your-email">#</a> 4. Wait till your data arrives in your email</h3><p>This can take a while. As Spotify states:</p><blockquote><p>We&#39;re currently gathering a copy of your personal data. This shouldn&#39;t take longer than 30 days. But don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll send you an email when it&#39;s ready.</p></blockquote><p>But in most of the cases you&#39;ll receive the data within a week. (Yes, I know thats a long wait, but trust me: its worth it ðŸ˜ƒ)</p><h3 id="_5-download-the-files"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_5-download-the-files">#</a> 5.

Duplicate streams will be filtered out, and there will be a lot of calculations made for each stream in order to save it securely in the database. Depending on the amount of streams and the amount of people importing their streams at once this can take just a couple seconds up to a couple of hours.</p><div class="custom-container tip"><p class="custom-container-title">TIP</p><p>You can close the website while your streams are being processed</p></div><p>Once all green progress bars have reached 100% (or &quot;Fully imported&quot;) you&#39;ll be ready to go.</p><p><img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/830562126560231464/856580928582189057/unknown.png" alt="Step 9 image"></p><h3 id="_10-ready-to-go"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_10-ready-to-go">#</a> 10.
