For example: if you&#39;ve requested the data on June 1st and you&#39;ve received the data on June 14th, the data will include streams untill ~June 12th. Since this sync is started on the moment you import your data, there will probably be a gap of about 2 days. If you&#39;re concerned about this gap you can manually turn on the sync after you&#39;ve requested your data.</p><h3 id="i-don-t-want-to-import-my-data-but-i-do-want-this-feature"><a class="header-anchor" href="#i-don-t-want-to-import-my-data-but-i-do-want-this-feature">#</a> I don&#39;t want to import my data but I do want this feature</h3><p>Of course you can enable this feature without importing your data, but please note that you wont be able to view (accurate) lifetime data.</p><h2 id="can-there-be-any-duplicates-between-my-imported-data-and-the-synced-data"><a class="header-anchor" href="#can-there-be-any-duplicates-between-my-imported-data-and-the-synced-data">#</a> Can there be any duplicates between my imported data and the synced data?</h2><p>No 😃</p>',11);a.render=function(e,a){return t};export default a;
