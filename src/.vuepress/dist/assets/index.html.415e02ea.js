Request your data from Spotify</h3><p>In order to request your <code>endsong.json</code> files you&#39;ll need to send Spotify a simple email. You can use this as a template:</p><blockquote><p>Hi, <br><br> I would like to receive a copy of my extended lifetime streaming history in technical endsong.json format. The data requested from the privacy tab on the spotify.com/account page only includes the data of last year, and I want my lifetime data (so the endsong.json files). A link to my Spotify profile is <code>link to your Spotify profile</code> and my username is <code>your username</code>. A song I&#39;ve recently added to my library is &quot;<code>name of a song youve recently added to your library</code>&quot; by <code>name of the artist</code>. And just to be sure: I don&#39;t want the data I can request myself with the button on my account page, I&#39;m looking for the &quot;endsong.json&quot; files. <br><br>Best regards, <br><code>your name</code></p></blockquote><p>You can send this email to <code>privacy@spotify.com</code>, and if you <strong>send this from the emailadress linked to your Spotify account</strong> that will make the process easier and a lot quicker. Otherwise they may ask for another way to verify your identification (naming a song you&#39;ve recently added to your library already does this, but they can still reject that).</p><h3 id="_2-confirm-your-request"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-confirm-your-request">#</a> 2. Confirm your request</h3><p>When your request is accepted by Spotify they&#39;ll email you a link to confirm the request. Click &quot;confirm&quot; and they&#39;ll start gathering your data. <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/830562126560231464/830562247663288411/step-2.png" alt="Step 2 image"></p><h3 id="_3-turn-on-the-streams-sync-to-prevent-a-gap-in-your-data"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-turn-on-the-streams-sync-to-prevent-a-gap-in-your-data">#</a> 3. Turn on the Streams Sync to prevent a gap in your data</h3><p>The files you receive from Spotify miss the last 2-5 days of data. For example: if you&#39;ve requested the data on June 1st and you&#39;ve received the data on June 14th, the data will include streams untill ~June 12th. Since you (of course) want accurate data you can turn on the Streams Sync after you&#39;ve requested your files (so at this step). You can do that in Settings &gt; Import management &gt; Sync streaminghistory. Make sure to set this to &quot;enabled&quot;. You can read more about the Stream Sync <a href="/streams/sync">here</a>)</p><p><img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/830562126560231464/870771640445829190/image0.png?width=211&amp;height=457" alt="Step 3 image"></p><h3 id="_4-wait-till-your-data-arrives-in-your-email"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-wait-till-your-data-arrives-in-your-email">#</a> 4. Wait till your data arrives in your email</h3><p>This can take a while. As Spotify states:</p><blockquote><p>We&#39;re currently gathering a copy of your personal data. This shouldn&#39;t take longer than 30 days. But don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll send you an email when it&#39;s ready.</p></blockquote><p>But in most of the cases you&#39;ll receive the data within a week. (Yes, I know thats a long wait, but trust me: its worth it 😃)</p><h3 id="_5-download-the-files"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_5-download-the-files">#</a> 5.

Duplicate streams will be filtered out, and there will be a lot of calculations made for each stream in order to save it securely in the database.
